	abstract = {<p>PAC-Bayesian set up involves a stochastic classifier characterized by a posterior distribution on a classifier set, offers a high probability bound on its averaged true risk and is robust to the training sample used. For a given posterior, this bound captures the trade off between averaged empirical risk and KL-divergence based model complexity term. Our goal is to identify an optimal posterior with the least PAC-Bayesian bound. We consider a finite classifier set and 5 distance functions: KL-divergence, its Pinsker{\textquoteright}s and a sixth degree polynomial approximations; linear and squared distances. Linear distance based model results in a convex optimization problem and we obtain a closed form expression for its optimal posterior. For uniform prior, this posterior has full support with weights negative-exponentially proportional to number of misclassifications. Squared distance and Pinsker{\textquoteright}s approximation bounds are possibly quasi-convex and are observed to have single local minimum. We derive fixed point equations (FPEs) using partial KKT system with strict positivity constraints. This obviates the combinatorial search for subset support of the optimal posterior. For uniform prior, exponential search on a full-dimensional simplex can be limited to an ordered subset of classifiers with increasing empirical risk values. These FPEs converge rapidly to a stationary point, even for a large classifier set when a solver fails. We apply these approaches to SVMs generated using a finite set of SVM regularization parameter values on 9 UCI datasets. The resulting optimal posteriors (on the set of regularization parameters) yield stochastic SVM classifiers with tight bounds. KL-divergence based bound is the tightest, but is computationally expensive due to its non-convex nature and multiple calls to a root finding algorithm. Optimal posteriors for all 5 distance functions have lowest 10\% test error values on most datasets, with that of linear distance being the easiest to obtain.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>(IEOR Seminar Series)</p>
	<p>Operations research supports decision-making in many complex systems\&nbsp;across domains. However, though OR is a well-established field in its\&nbsp;own right, it is quite unrecognised and under-appreciated. The problem\&nbsp;is compounded by the fact that OR professionals / researchers are\&nbsp;themselves quite unclear about "What is OR?", or unable to explain it\&nbsp;confidently or satisfactorily to the public at large. This vagueness\&nbsp;about OR often poses a barrier for novice learners/ students to join the\&nbsp;OR stream/ employ OR methods effectively. Further, OR community will be\&nbsp;increasingly looked upon to play a key role as an anchor to address\&nbsp;"wicked" problems (incl. sustainable development goals), and steer the\&nbsp;realisation of solutions. This requires us to have a common\&nbsp;understanding about OR, and perhaps introspect our role as OR\&nbsp;professionals.<br />
	<br />
	In this talk I will attempt to provide a satisfactory answer to the\&nbsp;question "What is OR?". Drawing on my own experiences, I argue for a\&nbsp;strong empirical base for research \&amp; practice activities of OR, and the\&nbsp;challenges therein. I also discuss the skill sets required to create<br />
	complete \&amp; holistic OR professionals. This, I believe, will go a long\&nbsp;way in building a strong community of complete OR professionals to\&nbsp;work\&nbsp;on problems that matter .</p>},

ESSMM posits itself as a better tool than Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) to analyze such a situation where a society strives to eradicate traits like corruption completely.

The mines need trains to complete delivery of coal by the arrival of ships at the terminal. The trains, on the other hand, are in limited supply and therefore the mines need to share this common resource. For this problem, we present a mixed integer programming formulation which minimises total weighted earliness, tardiness and operational costs. We also present a distributed algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation, which incorporates the volume and Wedelin algorithms. The strength of our distributed algorithm is demonstrated by an extensive computational experiment on several randomly generated instances.</p>},

Rural India is experiencing significant changes due to the pace of economic development in India. This includes changing consumption patterns, increasing exposure to different lifestyles and products, and increasing purchasing power. In order to understand the rural supply chain (RSC) better, an attempt was made to identify the factors that are pertinent in the Indian context. The factors have a profound impact in designing a suitable supply chain model for the rural markets. After identifying these factors, interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and fuzzy analysis was used to establish structural relationships among these factors to categorise them into sensitive and influential sets. The results obtained revealed a number of interesting facts about RSC, the details of which are presented in this paper.},

	(separable reward and state independent transition) discounted stochastic game. We propose<br />
	a variant of pollution tax model which captures more realistic situation than the model given<br />
	in [1]. We model this as a two player nonzero sum discounted stochastic game which does<br />
	not seem to have any special structure. We present some computational results on Nash<br />
	equilibrium of pollution tax model by using our trust region SQP-based algorithm given in<br />
	[2]. We describe some cases where our algorithm converges to only -Nash equilibrium. We<br />
	are able to avoid the situation of -Nash equilibrium by starting our algorithm from different<br />
	initial point. We also establishes the fact that an instance of pollution tax model admits<br />
	a Nash equilibrium which is independent of the discount factor close to 1, an extension of<br />
	Blackwell optimality in Markov decision processes.<br />

Precise definition and analysis of \&ldquo;evolutionarily stable strategy against multiple mutations\&rdquo; are not available in the literature. In this article, we formalize evolutionarily robustness against multiple mutations. Our main result shows that such a robust strategy is necessarily a pure strategy. Further, we study some equivalent formulations and properties of evolutionary stability against multiple mutations. In particular, we characterize completely the robustness against multiple mutations in 2\&times;2 games.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The paper relates to a study carried out to develop an integrated  framework capable of serving as a decision support system to deal with  the problem of outsourcing. Initially, a survey was carried out among  the Indian industries which revealed that most of the firms followed  specific procedures for outsourcing and followed simple qualitative  procedures for source selection. However, there was no evidence that  they used any quantitative\&ndash;based decision making tools for justifying  outsourcing, selection of vendors, etc. The framework developed is  capable of taking into account both qualitative and quantitative factors  in making outsourcing decisions. The framework uses multi stage  procedure involving analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment  analysis (DEA) and preemptive goal programming (PGP). At the outset, the  framework uses an AHP\&ndash;based methodology to arrive at a decision whether  to outsource or not and if outsourced, whom to outsource. This is  followed by a DEA\&ndash;based procedure, wherein the relative efficiencies of  the priority sources, identified by AHP are found. Finally, an AHP\&ndash;PGP  formulation identifies the best source for the given targets of the  outsourcer. The details of the framework and how was it used with  specific cases are presented in this paper.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Outsourcing has become a common terminology among the industries, which has provided a thrust in achieving the organisational goals. Organisations are narrowing the range of processes and functions they perform internally, and today\&amp;$\#$39;s business environment relies substantially on third party business and service providers. This trend is very much on the increase in India. A survey of the Indian industries was carried out to get an insight into the level of maturity of the companies as far as outsourcing is concerned. The survey covered issues related to various facets of outsourcing including the functions outsourced, reasons for outsourcing, benefits obtained, problems faced and criteria for vendor selection. The response obtained from more than 100 participants drawn from various sectors, including manufacturing, information technology and service, was subjected to preliminary analysis and multivariate statistical test such as factor analysis. The results of these analyses provide significant insight into the perspectives and practices of business process outsourcing (BPO) in Indian industries, especially in terms of the relationships that seem to exist among different functions outsourced, criteria for preference among the vendors, levels of advantages offered by BPO and the degree of problems faced by outsourcing organisations. The results also provide a good base to develop an effective decision support system. The details of the survey, the analysis and the key learning points are presented in this paper.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>We provide a production planning framework for variant rich customized products (such as automobiles or computers), by calculating entirely constructible configuration sets for future customer demands in a novel manner. Most of the established approaches analyze configurations out of historical order banks for estimating the appropriate set of future demands. In the current environment of rapidly changing designs and highly customized products, historical demands cannot easily be extrapolated to capture future market demand and may not even retain future product document restrictions. Especially for new products where no order history is available, we need methods to calculate constructible product configurations that satisfy sales and production requirements simultaneously.</p>
	<p><br />
	On the other hand, even though past product configurations may not remain valid for future product designs, they may contain interesting information about correlation between attributes of a product reflecting customer buying behavior. This information should also be reflected by the configuration set that we generate.\&nbsp;</p>
	<p><br />
	We present a method that transforms logic propositions related to product technology into algebraic constraints. To this, we add sales and production constraints together with attribute association constraints (derived from past order history). Sales constraints could be in the form of take rates of key modules or attributes and these would anyway need to be forecasted accurately for capacity planning, vendor negotiations and some marketing decisions.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The order set generation problem is formulated as a large scale 0-1 optimization model. We used column generation and other techniques to solve this large scale optimization model.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>We consider a two player nonzero sum cost coupled constrained stochastic game with expected<br />
	average costs as discussed in [2]. These games are also known as decentralized stochastic game<br />
	because instead of controlling a single markov chain jointly, each player controls its own Markov<br />
	chain which do not depend on the actions of other player. The existence of the stationary Nash<br />
	equilibrium for these games in case of N -player is shown under the irreducibility and Slater<br />
	type conditions [2]. Under the assumptions given in [2] we show that the stationary Nash<br />
	equilibrium of two player constrained stochastic game as discussed in [2], where the constraints<br />
	of each player depend on the strategies of the other player also, can be obtained from the global<br />
	minima of certain mathematical program. We also show the converse, i.e., corresponding to a<br />
	stationary Nash equilibrium of this constrained stochastic game, there is a global minima of<br />
	the corresponding mathematical program. In particular, if the constraints of each player do<br />
	not depend on the strategies of the other player, then the mathematical program reduces to a<br />
	non-convex quadratic program. The zero sum game of this class, where the constraints of one<br />
	player do not depend on the strategies of other player is considered in [3]. These games with<br />
	both unichain and multichain structure on the state processes of both the players can be solved<br />
	by linear programs [3]. The primal-dual pair of linear programs for unichain case as given in<br />
	[3] can be recovered from our quadratic program. Computational algorithms for finding global<br />
	minima of non-convex quadratic program exist and hence, one can compute Nash equilibria<br />
	of the above constrained stochastic games that we are considering. Also, applications of such<br />
	models include in wireless networks [1, 2, 3].</p>

Lifting has been shown to be very effective in developing strong valid inequalities for linear integer programming and it has been successfully used to solve such problems with branch-and-cut algorithms. Here we generalize the theory of lifting to conic integer programming, i.e., integer programs with conic constraints. We show how to derive conic valid inequalities for a conic integer program from conic inequalities valid for its lower-dimensional restrictions. In order to simplify the computations, we also discuss sequence-independent lifting for conic integer programs. When the cones are restricted to nonnegative orthants, conic lifting reduces to the lifting for linear integer programming as one may expect.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Railway operations are planned in four levels of hierarchy: (i)  strategic, (ii) tactical, (iii) operational control and (iv) real-time  control. Scheduling is an initial time allocation of resources to meet  demands in completing a task and rescheduling is a later modification of  such resource allocations. An extensive set of some major railway  scheduling and rescheduling operations as published in literature is  analyzed in this paper. We observe that many authors consider scheduling  as a strategic or tactical operation and rescheduling as an operational  or real-time control. Several unexplored issues that are strategic or  tactical per se, but hold considerable rationale for operational and  real-time control (and vice versa) of railway operations are brought  out. It is interpreted that (i) in practice, both scheduling and  rescheduling are inadvertently performed at all hierarchical levels and  (ii) operational feasibility at a hierarchical\&nbsp; level is dependent on effectiveness of modeling at other hierarchical  levels. Finally we present an array of potential research issues that  are significant in practical railway operations. Our discussions are  based on an understanding of objectives, modeling details, approaches  and issues arising from the diversity in railway operations and to a  less detail on solution methods and techniques.</p>},

We use a linear programming model and data preprocessing and postprocessing to determine the optimal capacity allocation on multiple travel legs. The model uses a simple, effective capacity management tool. For historical and social reasons, Indian Railways splits its train capacity based on user and type of travel. Determining the optimal split of such capacity is nontrivial. We deal with the specific issue of the spatial split of seats in an end-to-end travel segment within a given travel class. This addresses the needs of end-to-end and en route travelers. When we applied our model to 17 Indian Railways trains, we achieved increases of 2.6 to 29.3 percent in revenue, 6.7 to 30.8 percent in load factors, and 8.4 to 29 percent in passengers carried. \&copy; 2010 INFORMS.</p>},

Recently, optimal power flow tracing methods have been proposed to \&quot;explicitly\&quot; model fairness constraints in the tracing framework. This paper, further, strengthens the tracing-compliant min-max fair cost allocation approach. The min-max model proposed in this paper is robust. It addresses concerns like scalability, numerical stability and termination in a finite number of steps while searching the optimal solution. We also propose a methodology to model DISCOMs and GENCOs as coalition within min-max framework. Case studies on an all India network of 1699 nodes and comparison with average participation and marginal participation methods bring out the better conflict resolution feature of the proposed approach. A method to model HVDC lines within the marginal participation scheme is also proposed. Quantitative and qualitative comparison of various TSU cost allocation methods on such a large system is another noteworthy contribution of the paper. \&copy; 2010 IEEE.</p>},

This problem has very close association with various financial factors in business and therefore with the Key Management Ratios (KMRs) which are of considerable interest to corporate managers. The language of money binds various segments of any supply chain, in which the operational managers are busy dealing with information flow and material flow, to facilitate the desired cash flow to happen. Business management ratios are considered as the guiding stars for corporate managers as they are believed to capture the real status of the business, under different scenarios. However, as far as the Supply Chain Flexibility (SCF) is concerned, these two issues are not discussed jointly. There are many types of supply chain flexibilities and various KMRs. It is perhaps difficult to establish generalised relationships between these two sets of entities. A study was carried out to assess the influence that may be exerted by various types of SCF on the elements of KMRs and eventually, the KMRs themselves, the findings of which are reported in this paper.

The interface specification models have been broadly classified into four types: Entity transfer, Data exchange, Resource sharing, and Event notification. The specifications define the minimum set of messages required to realize a situation. The specifications are described in detail using Unified Modelling Language sequence diagrams. A prototype distributed simulation, developed using a commercial-off-the-shelf simulation package, is used to demonstrate the proposed specifications. Finally, to test the validity of the proposed specifications, statistical results obtained from the constructed distributed simulation are compared against those from a single (non-distributed) simulation.</p>},

At each echelon, there is a choice of service providers and the specific problem we solve is that of determining a cost-optimal mix of service providers so as to achieve a desired level of end-to-end delivery performance. In this paper, we develop a mechanism design framework for addressing this problem and propose two incentive compatible mechanisms: Supply Chain Formation - Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (SCF-DSIC) and Supply Chain Formation - Bayesian Incentive Compatibility (SCF-BIC). We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology using the example of a three echelon manufacturing supply chain. Copyright \&copy; 2009, Inderscience Publishers.</p>},

To this end, we had proposed a conceptual framework earlier, which involve a multi-scale federation of interwoven simulations and decision models to support integrated analysis of stability and performance in hierarchical supply chain planning. In this paper, it is further developed, fully implemented, and demonstrated via extensive experiments involving a realistic three-echelon conjoined supply chain system. A high level architecture (HLA) is used to integrate the distributed decision and simulation models. For the considered supply chains, various hybrid models have been successfully developed conforming to the framework, and experimental results revealed the advantage of our framework in robust supply chain planning.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>A contractual arrangement between supply chain partners improves the coordination between partners, thereby improving the supply chain performance. This paper models the impact of asset investment (vehicles) by the carrier (logistics provider) on a supply chain. The decision of asset investment by the carrier is driven by its own operational goal of profit maximisation rather than the overall supply chain performance. We define a two sided penalty contract between the shipper and the carrier to achieve supply chain coordination, in terms of optimal investment of asset by the carrier. Under this contract setting, the carrier (shipper) has to pay a penalty (demurrage) if shipments (vehicles) wait for vehicles (shipments). To avoid the oversupply of the vehicles (shipments), demurrage (penalty) is paid only for one vehicle (shipment) at any time. We first propose a set of conditions that define a feasible and viable contract. The study examines when the feasible region is non empty (in the space of contract parameters) and also its sensitivity with regard to major external parameters, the cost parameters and the arrival rate of shipments. We provide a brief analysis of the multi-objective nature of the problem of setting contract parameters. Copyright \&copy; 2008, Inderscience Publishers.</p>},

In this paper, we consider the problem of pricing for congestion control in the case of a network of nodes under a single service class and multiple queues, and present a multi-layered pricing scheme. We propose an algorithm for finding the optimal state dependent price levels for individual queues, at each node. The pricing policy used depends on a weighted average queue length at each node. This helps in reducing frequent price variations and is in the spirit of the random early detection (RED) mechanism used in TCP/IP networks. We observe in our numerical results a considerable improvement in performance using our scheme over that of a recently proposed related scheme in terms of both throughput and delay performance. In particular, our approach exhibits a throughput improvement in the range of 34 to 69 percent in all cases studied (over all routes) over the above scheme. \&copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.</p>},

	<p align="left">Reverse logistics refers to the management of theflow of return goodsfrom the point of consumption to the point of origin, for the purpose of recapturing value by either making it re-usable in a market or by proper disposal. Strict environmental regulations and customer demand for green products,coupled with business opportunities in remanufacturing used products have resulted in producers taking back their products after use. When a returned product reaches the producer, there is anoption of remanufacturing the product to meet demand (apartfrom manufacturingfresh products), or stocking it for later use, or disposing it. In this backdrop, we propose periodic review inventory control policies involving stocking and disposal options. Selectively stocking returned items turnsout to be equivalent to manipulating the eflective lead time of remanufacturing of returned items, which is known to influence the total costs. We use simulation to establishgood policies of diflerent types; a single order level (one-parameter) policy and two-parameter policies involving stocking and disposal options. We propose a heuristic for the single parameter disposal policy and suggest a numerical search method for computing the optimal values of two-parameter policies. However, we recommend one-parameter policies as they have shown to be suficiently eflective in performance, and are much easier to implement. Such policies are expected to form a part of the planning systems in organisations in future, due to increased legislation and commercial pressures.</p>

	<p align="left">In the planning of operations in suburban train services, an important issue is rake linking. In this, physical train units called rakes (in this context, a standardized set of cars, including motor coaches in their composition) are to be assigned to services that are planned as part of the timetable. Doing this optimally (with as few rakes as possible or with as little empty running as possible) has a signi cant impact on the overall costs and reliability of services. We have modeled this problem as a network ow problem and implemented it on a real life operation (Western Railway, in Mumbai). This exercise also generates rake cycles which describe the sequence of services to be done by each rake, and a perturbation analysis on parameters to identify actions for improvement. A subsequent decision is the allocation of platforms and stabling lines at terminals. The Rake Linker has been tested on a service network involving more than a thousand services on Western Railway on the Mumbai suburban railway network.</p>

The approach allows federates in the simulation system to advance their local times at full speed while it is safe to do so. That is, the simulation moves rapidly to the minimum next epoch (interaction) event time, which is calculated using the minimum sojourn time for each federate, and then slows for federation synchronization. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a manufacturing supply chain simulation composed of four distributed federates. Experiments are executed to benchmark the proposed epoch time synchronization method against conventional conservative synchronization methods to show typical improvements for simulation operation. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach reduces supply chain simulation execution time significantly while maintaining complete accuracy as compared with traditional conservative federation coordination approaches. \&copy; 2006 Society of Manufacturing Engineers.</p>},

Hierarchical production planning provides a formal bridge between long-term plans and short-term schedules. A hybrid simulation-based hierarchical production planning architecture consisting of system dynamics (SD) components for the enterprise level planning and discrete event simulation (DES) components for the shop-level scheduling is presented. The architecture consists of the Optimizer, Performance Monitor and Simulator modules at each decision level. The Optimizers select the optimal set of control parameters based on the estimated behaviour of the system. The enterprise-level simulator (SD model) and shop-level simulator (DES model) interact with each other to evaluate the plan. Feedback control loops are employed at each level to monitor the performance and update the control parameters. Functional and process models of the proposed architecture are specified using IDEF. The internal mechanisms of the modules are also described. The modules are interfaced using High Level Architecture (HLA).

Members of a supply chain, activity definitions for each member, and information and material flow among members are discussed. IDEF\&empty; functional modeling tool has been used to model the functions of the system and the relationships among the functions. The interaction between the members of the system is then illustrated using time-sequence diagrams, and the behavior of each member is represented using the deterministic finite state automata. These formal models have formed the basis for the development of the distributed simulation system. Reusable simulation models for each of the members of the system have been developed using commercial simulation tools such as Arena\&trade; and ProModel\&trade;. The High Level Architecture (HLA) Run Time Infrastructure (RTI) has been used to provide an interface to create the distributed simulation system. Preliminary performance tests have been conducted to evaluate the suitability of the proposed system in the Internet environment.

The use of distributed simulation technology allows each potential partner to hide any proprietary information in the implementation of the individual simulation, but still provide enough information to evaluate the supply chain as a whole. \&copy; International Journal of Industrial Engineering.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>DiffServ, the vehicle for providing relative QoS in the Internet is also easily amenable to simple and effective pricing mechanisms. By pricing access to a relative QoS, we can model a DiffServ node as a \&rsquo;Join Minimum Cost Queue\&rsquo; in which an arriving customer (packet or connection) determines the relative cost as a function of the congestion in the different queues and their access prices and decides to take service from that queue for which the cost is minimum. The Paris Metro pricing system and its work conserving variant called the Tirupati pricing are analyzed in this paper in the presence of multiclass traffic and for static pricing using an infinite buffer model. Extensive numerical results help describe the behavior of the performance measures like mean queue lengths, revenue rates and customer disutility rates as functions of the various system parameters. Two of the more interesting observations are that the disutility and revenue rate are not monotonic or convex functions of price and the revenue rate is very sensitive to the behavior of the delay sensitive class. We also analyze the finite buffer case and study the loss rate, revenue rate and also the convergence of these performance measures to the infinite buffer values as the buffer sizes increase. \&copy; 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of supply chain is typically carried out using aggregated information to maintain the level of complexity of the simulation model at a manageable level. Advances in simulation have provided the ability to build comprehensive (detailed), modular models. The quantitative effect of detailed modelling on the corresponding analysis is investigated in this paper. A three-echelon supply chain is analysed using simulation models of varying levels of detail. Using each of these models, four sets of intensive experiments are performed. The first experiment intends to test whether the supply chain dynamics themselves depend on the modelling accuracy that represents the supply chain. The second and third experiments are conducted to test whether the effectiveness of the strategies employed to reduce the supply chain dynamics vary depending on the type (different detail) of model representing the supply chain. In the fourth experiment, statistical techniques are employed to identify which modelling aspect has the most influence on the supply chain dynamics. It is found that the approximations used in modelling, such as delays and capacity, have more impact on the outcome of supply chain analysis than end customer demand, Evidence that both the basic problem (supply chain dynamics) and the solution (strategy to reduce the dynamics) are greatly influenced by the modelling accuracy are presented.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>We consider a system of K parallel queues providing different grades of service through each of the queues and serving a multiclass customer population. Service differentiation is achieved by specifying different join prices to the queues. Customers of class j define a cost function \&psi;<sub>ij</sub>(c <sub>i</sub>,x<sub>i</sub>) for taking service from queue i when the join price for queue i is c<sub>i</sub> and congestion in queue i is x<sub>i</sub> and join the queue that minimizes \&psi;<sub>ij</sub>(\&middot;,\&middot;). Such a queuing system will be called the \&quot;join minimum cost queue\&quot; (JMCQ) and is a generalization of the join shortest queue (JSQ) system. Non-work-conserving (called Paris Metro pricing system) and work-conserving (called the Tirupati system) versions of the JMCQ are analyzed when the cost to an arrival of joining a queue is a convex combination of the join price for that queue and the expected waiting time in that queue at the arrival epoch. Our main results are for a two-queue system. We obtain stability conditions and performance bounds. To obtain the lower and upper performance bounds, we propose two quasi-birth-death (QBD) processes that are derived from the original systems by suitably truncating the state space. The state space truncation in the non-work-conserving JMCQ follows the method of van Houtum and colleagues. We then show that this method is not applicable to the work-conserving JMCQ and provide sample-path-based proofs to show that the number in each queue is bounded by the number in the corresponding queues of these QBD processes. These sample-path proof techniques might also be of independent interest. We then show that the performance measures like mean queue length and revenue rate of the system are also bounded by the corresponding quantities of these QBD processes. Numerical examples show that these bounds are fairly tight. Finally, we generalize some of these results to systems with more queues.</p>},

Several performance measures like the throughput of the system, fraction of arrivals that actually enter into the system, utilizations of the work stations, etc., are obtained. Further, design of such fork-join systems in terms of buffer size configurations for maximizing the throughput of the system, or for minimizing the mean waiting time of a typical job, or for minimizing the Work-In-Process of the system is done using the above performance prediction approach. Such optimal configurations exhibit some interesting features. Analytical models are often used to understand the performance of manufacturing systems and also the associated decision making trade-offs that arise in their operations. We consider a model of a system with two assembly lines and a single join operation. It takes into account the finite capacity of the system and considers certain types of randomness in the inter-arrival times of the orders and processing and assembly of the tasks. Most models either consider that there are no external arrivals that correspond to orders or assume that assembly is instantaneous. We propose an analytical model to numerically obtain useful performance measures like fraction of orders that are actually accepted, mean number of tasks in the system, etc. We next use this technique to design such systems by finding buffer configurations that maximizes the throughput of the system, etc. We note some interesting features of such optimal designs. \&copy; 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {<p>Motivated by certain situations in manufacturing systems and communication networks, we look into the problem of maximizing the profit in a queueing system with linear reward and cost structure and having a choice of selecting the streams of Poisson arrivals according to an independent Markov chain. We view the system as a MMPP/GI/1 queue and seek to maximize the profits by optimally choosing the stationary probabilities of the modulating Markov chain. We consider two formulations of the optimization problem. The first one (which we call the PUT problem) seeks to maximize the profit per unit time whereas the second one considers the maximization of the profit per accepted customer (the PAC problem). In each of these formulations, we explore three separate problems. In the first one, the constraints come from bounding the utilization of an infinite capacity server; in the second one the constraints arise from bounding the mean queue length of the same queue; and in the third one the finite capacity of the buffer reflect as a set of constraints. In the problems bounding the utilization factor of the queue, the solutions are given by essentially linear programs, while the problems with mean queue length constraints are linear programs if the service is exponentially distributed. The problems modeling the finite capacity queue are non-convex programs for which global maxima can be found. There is a rich relationship between the solutions of the PUT and PAC problems. In particular, the PUT solutions always make the server work at a utilization factor that is no less than that of the PAC solutions.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>In this article we examine the transient performance of a flexible machine centre that processes several classes of jobs with significant setup times and with priority scheduling. Our results show that the transient performance of the system over typical observation intervals can be significantly different from the performance predicted by steady-state analysis. The machine centre serves three classes of jobs - class 1, class 2 and class 3; class 3 jobs have non-preemptive priority over jobs of class 1 and class 2. The results show that the throughput and cycle time of class 1 and class 2 jobs are affected quite dramatically by the arrival of class 3 jobs. However, over a typical observation period in the initial evolution of the system, steady-state results overestimate this effect of the high priority jobs whereas the more credible estimates are given by transient analysis. The transient analysis is carried out by solving explicitly the corresponding Markov chains, using a higher level stochastic Petri net model to generate the Markov chains. \&copy; 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This requires a holistic description of alternative technologies through a unified set of attributes; followed by a ranking of alternatives within a given development perspective. In this paper the problem of choice of technology is viewed as a technology-ranking problem and is studied by relating it to two development perspectives labeled as: 1) regional self-reliant development and 2) market or growth-oriented development. Five technology alternatives in toilet soap-making are ranked by the application of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). It is shown that the rankings are significantly altered when the development perspective is changed.</p>},
