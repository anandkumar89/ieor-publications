An integrated PI-SEIRS model has been described, wherein the demand to the PI component depends on the infected population, and the recovery rate of patients depends on the
		timely supply of medicines. The performance comparison of PI-SEIRS model and the standalone SEIRS model is carried out using an illustrative influenza epidemic data set. Results show that the supply chain or inventory effects on the epidemic dynamics is significant. A given epidemic can be caused by high infectivity parameter with sufficient supply of medicine or with a low infectivity parameter but insufficient supply of medicine. Also, the use of a standalone SEIRS model overestimates the disease severity, compared to the combined inventory control and epidemics model.},

	Palletization is an essential part of supply chain (SC) logistics. Most often the pallets are provided by a third party, who reuses the pallets across multiple stages of the SC operations in the same or even different SCs. Disruptions in pallet supply will affect the SC operations of the customers. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming based facility location models for the pallet supplier, given their customer SC networks with demand flows. The key decisions are the location of pallet warehouses which will supply ready-to-use pallets to various customer locations, as well as collect, inspect and repair used pallets from customers. Note that the supply point of pallets to a customer{\textquoteright}s chain may be very different from its point of return, which make the problem non-trivial. The model incorporates multiple trips of pallets as well as end-of-life scenarios. Various operational configurations, such as, strict-return-of-pallet-to-origin-warehouse, supply-and/or-return-of-pallets-to-closest-warehouse, etc. are modeled and analyzed using randomly generated instances. Further the impact of information exchange between the customer SCs and pallet provider is analyzed.<br />

	abstract = {<p>In this paper, we present an iterative scheme integrating simulation with an optimization model, for solving complex problems, viz., job shop scheduling. The classical job shop scheduling problem which is NP-Hard, has often been modelled as Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model and solved using exact algorithms (for example, branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut) or using meta-heuristics (for example, Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing). In the proposed Iterative Simulation-Optimization (ISO) approach, we use a modified formulation of the scheduling problem where the operational aspects of the job shop are captured only in the simulation model. Two new decision variables,\&nbsp;controller delays\&nbsp;and\&nbsp;queue priorities\&nbsp;are used to introduce feedback constraints, that help exchange information between the two models. The proposed method is tested using benchmark instances from the OR library. The results indicate that the method gives near optimal schedules in a reasonable computational time.</p>},

	In our survivable network design problem, we consider survivability constraints which imply that in the case of the deletion of any single edge in the cut, the reserved capacities of the remaining edges should be large enough to satisfy the demand across the cut. We examine the polyhedron described by Bienstock and Muratore (2000) for the case of a single edge failure and develop a relation between the polyhedron and its linear relaxation in terms of Chv\&acute;atal inequalities.</p>},

Most of the established approaches analyse configurations out of historical order banks for estimating the appropriate set of future demands. In the current environment of rapidly changing designs and highly customized products, historical demands cannot easily be extrapolated to capture future market demand and may not even retain future product document restrictions. In this paper, our aim is to generate configuration sets such that (1) they represent customers buying behaviour (derived from configurations produced in the past and sales planning at aggregate level) (2) they are consistent with the product documentation. Configuration generation is formulated as guided search procedures which utilize the Satisfiability framework. Selection of configuration sets for planning is done by a large scale optimization model. We use column generation and other techniques to solve this large scale optimization model.</p>

Thus in scenarios with diverse users (speeds spanning over large ranges), it would be inefficient to serve all of them using common cell radius and it is practically infeasible to design different cell sizes for different speeds. We alternatively propose to allocate power to an user based on its speed. Higher power virtually increases the cell size. We obtain an expression for optimal power division, optimal for busy probability and load factor (a QoS influenced by handover losses), for any given average power constraint and cell size. We show that the optimal power depends linearly upon the speed. We reinforce the theory via numerical simulations, illustrating good improvements in the performance (upto 60\% in busy probability and 30\% in load factor) with optimal power law. The improvement in performance increases as either the path loss increases or as the range of speeds to be supported by the system increases.</p>},

	<p>In the environment of customized products (e.g. automotive, computer), their exists large number of components, among which many are available in more than one variant. Customer may be able to specify some component variants and then the other components may need to be specified to satisfy engineering and legal dependencies, some of which can be quite complex. In order to fulfil individualized customer demands in a short period of time, manufacturers need to maintain an efficient portfolio of components. In this paper we have proposed an approach for product variety management by identifying such efficient portfolios from the future product design and past behavior of customers.</p>

	capacity by introducing a new class of customers (secondary<br />
	class) without affecting the service level of its current customers<br />
	(primary class). A delay dependent pre-emptive queue priority<br />
	is used across classes. Two optimization models are formulated<br />
	to maximize the profit of the resource owner, depending on the<br />
	value of the relative queue discipline priority parameter. The first<br />
	optimization model, valid when the relative parameter is finite,<br />
	is a constrained non convex optimization problem. The second<br />
	optimization model, valid when the relative parameter is infinite,<br />
	is a convex optimization probelm. These optimization problems<br />
	are solved and the results are discussed. A finite step algorithm<br />
	to get the optimal operating parameters (pricing, service level<br />

	abstract = {<p>Distributed simulation is an emerging technique for simulation of supply chains consisting of multiple independent detailed discrete-event models. Time synchronization is one of the critical issues that affect the accuracy of results, network load and execution time. An Advanced Look-ahead Based Approach (ALBA), a hybrid conservative approach for time synchronization, is proposed that allows the models to run as-fast-as-possible to the nearest interaction event. This is achieved using an improved supply chain domain specific look-ahead algorithm that handles multiple types of interactions. The effect of stochasticity of the models on the performance of the look-ahead algorithm is discussed. Also, the performance of ALBA is appraised against two other hybrid time synchronization approaches in literature. Experimental results using a four player distributed supply chain simulation show that ALBA functions better than the other approaches in terms of network communication load and execution time. \&copy; 2007 IEEE.</p>},

Two of these algorithms are based on the smoothed functional (SF) technique while two others are based on the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) method. They differ from each other in the way perturbations are obtained and also the manner in which projections and parameter updates are performed. All our algorithms use two simulations and two-timescale stochastic approximation. As an application setting, we consider the important problem of admission control of packets in communication networks under dependent service times. We consider a discrete time slotted queueing model of the system and consider two different scenarios - one where the service times have a dependence on the system state and the other where they depend on the number of arrivals in a time slot. Under our settings, the simulated objective function appears ill-behaved with multiple local minima and a unique global minimum characterized by a sharp dip in the objective function in a small region of the parameter space. We compare the performance of our algorithms on these settings and observe that the two SF algorithms show the best results overall. In fact, in many cases studied, SF algorithms converge to the global minimum. \&copy; 2007 IEEE.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Pricing is an effective tool to control congestion and achieve quality of service (QoS) provisioning for multiple differentiated levels of service. In this paper, we consider the problem of pricing for congestion control in the case of a network of nodes under multiple service classes. Our work draws upon [1] and [2] in various ways. We use the Tlrupatl pricing scheme in conjunction with the stochastic approximation based adaptive pricing methodology for queue control (proposed in [1]) for minimizing network congestion. However, unlike the methodology of [1] where pricing for entire routes is directly considered, we consider prices for individual link-service grade tuples. Further, we adapt the methodology proposed in [2] for a single-node scenario to the case of a network of nodes, for evaluating performance in terms of price, revenue rate and disutility. We obtain considerable performance improvements using our approach over that in [1]. In particular, our approach exhibits a throughput improvement in the range of 54 to 80 percent in all cases studied (over all routes) while exhibiting a lower packet delay in the range of 26 to 38 percent over the scheme in [1]. \&copy; 2007 IEEE.</p>},

We design elegant optimal procurement mechanisms for two different situations. In the first situation, each supplier specifies the maximum quantity that can be supplied together with a per unit price. For this situation, we design an optimal mechanism S-OPT (Optimal with Simple bids). In the more generalized case, each supplier specifies discounts based on the volume of supply. In this case, we design an optimal mechanism VD-OPT (Optimal with Volume Discount bids). The VD-OPT mechanism uses the S-OPT mechanism as a building block.

In supply chains that handle perishable products, inventory management is already a complex problem and the management of products in a dynamic-pricing environment is even more challenging. Monitoring and control of time-sensitive products can be facilitated by the application of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, which enables non-contact, real-time data collection and efficient interfacing with the management control system in the supply chain. This paper describes an integrated framework for inventory management and pricing in a discrete time (periodic review and ordering) framework, and describes an efficient algorithm, including a new approximation, for the related optimization problem. We then propose a suitable architecture for the application of RFID technology in this context, to realize the potential benefits.</p>},

	abstract = {Today, there is little understanding of how local decisions and disturbances impact the global performance of the supply chain. In this research, we analyze the interactions between the planning decisions of different members of the supply chain, considering the operational aspects at each member and the robustness of the plan, using multi-resolution hybrid models. To this end, a novel hybrid architecture and methodology consisting of simulation (system dynamic and discrete-event) and optimization modules is proposed. The proposed methodology, applicable to general supply chains, is divided into fours stages: plan stability analysis (Stage I), plan optimization (Stages II), schedule optimization (Stage III) and concurrent decision evaluation (Stage IV). Functional and process models of the proposed architecture are specified using formal IDEF tools. A realistic three-echelon conjoined supply chain system characterized by communicative and collaborative (VMI) configurations is analyzed in this research. Comprehensive SD models of each player of the supply chain have been developed. General conditions of the stability (settings of control parameters that produce stable response) are derived using z -transformation techniques (Stage I), and insights into the behavior of the supply chain are gained. Next, a novel method for the integration of the stability analysis with performance analysis (optimization) is presented (Stage II) by employing the derived stability conditions derived as additional constraints within the optimization models. Next, in Stage III, the scheduling at each chain partner using discrete-event simulation (DES) modeling techniques is addressed. In Stage IV, the optimality of the SD control parameters (from Stage II) and DES operational policies (from Stage III) for each member are concurrently evaluated by integrating the SD and DES models. Evaluation in Stage IV is performed to better understand the global consequence of the locally optimal decisions determined at each supply chain member. A generic infrastructure has been developed using High Level Architecture (HLA) to integrate the distributed decision and simulation models. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the proposed architecture for the analysis of distributed supply chains. The progressions of cost based objective function from Stages I-III are compared with that from the concurrent evaluation in Stage IV. Also the ability of the proposed methodology to capture the effect of dynamic perturbations within the supply chain system is illustrated.},

The architecture consists of four modules: Enterprise-level decision maker, SD model of enterprise, Shop-level decision maker and DES model of shop.

We first discuss three time synchronization methods: 1) conservative, 2) optimistic, and 3) scaled real-time. To overcome problems of each of these static approaches, we propose a neural network based adaptive approach, which will react to the dynamic federation environment. In this paper, the framework of the neural network is discussed, and partial experimental results conducted for a distributed supply chain simulation are investigated which will be used as input to train the neural network.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Due to the stochastic and dynamic nature of a shop floor, which cannot be perfectly predicted, the actual events in the shop can be considerably different from those specified in the original schedule. Therefore, corrective actions should be taken to enhance the degraded performance of the original schedule. This paper presents a distributed adaptive control system composed of intelligent agents that will perform adaptive scheduling and schedule execution. The major features of the proposed system include 1) the distribution of the tasks among the independent agents, 2) the development of a passive supervisory component, which gains knowledge from the system proceedings, and 3) the use of artificial intelligence techniques to dynamically map the global performance and the state of the system to the local decision making rules of the distributed agents. In this paper, the framework and design issues for the proposed system are discussed.</p>},

By pricing access to a relative QoS, we can model a DiffServ node as a \&quot;Join Minimum Cost Queue\&quot; in which an arriving customer (packet or connection) determines the relative cost as a function of the congestion in the different queues and their access prices and decides to take service from that queue for which the cost is minimum. The Paris Metro pricing system and its work conserving variant called the Tirupati pricing are analyzed in this paper in the presence of multiclass traffic and for static pricing. Two of the more interesting observations are that the disutility and revenue rate are not monotonic or convex functions of price and the revenue rate is very sensitive to the behavior of the delay sensitive class.</p>},

Uniqueness of this research stems from the use of multiple models with varying degrees of detail representing the same supply chain. The significance of a detailed supply chain model on the quality of result is made clear. Factors employed to build an abstract to a detailed model include: transportation and production delay, demand at the retailer, and production and transportation capacity. It is shown that the system dynamics itself varies with increasing detail in the model. In addition, it is examined to see if a strategy found effective in improving the system dynamics with an abstract model is effective with a detailed model. It is established that the strategy found to be the most effective on an abstract model is not always the best strategy for the real supply chain.</p>},

Each company or candidate can use a simulation of its facilities to determine if it has the capability to perform its individual function in the virtual enterprise. Then, these simulations can be integrated into a distributed simulation of the complete enterprise, and used to predict the viability and profitability of the proposed product collaboration. In this paper, a prototype distributed simulation for such a purpose is presented. First, information flows as well as material flows among members in a virtual enterprise are identified using IDEF\&Oslash;, a formal function modeling method. Sequences of the identified functions are then presented using the finite state automata formalism. These interactions are then implemented for a commercial simulation package. Finally, a distributed simulation composed of three individual simulations is successfully tested across platforms over both the internet and the local area network.</p>},

Simplifications and assumptions made in traditional operations scheduling, such as disregarding material handling and buffers, have created questions concerning the fidelity of scheduling and implementing them in production systems. Since the simulation is used as an online task generator in a simulation-based control system, invalid schedules cause catastrophic results or system deadlocking (blocking) in the shop floor. In this paper, the assumptions made in scheduling are investigated in order to determine if schedules can be actually implemented as intended. In addition, two prominent scheduling algorithms, Johnson\&rsquo;s Algorithm and Jackson\&rsquo;s Algorithm, are investigated to determine whether and in what conditions they work properly.</p>},
