	abstract = {<p>PAC-Bayesian set up involves a stochastic classifier characterized by a posterior distribution on a classifier set, offers a high probability bound on its averaged true risk and is robust to the training sample used. For a given posterior, this bound captures the trade off between averaged empirical risk and KL-divergence based model complexity term. Our goal is to identify an optimal posterior with the least PAC-Bayesian bound. We consider a finite classifier set and 5 distance functions: KL-divergence, its Pinsker{\textquoteright}s and a sixth degree polynomial approximations; linear and squared distances. Linear distance based model results in a convex optimization problem and we obtain a closed form expression for its optimal posterior. For uniform prior, this posterior has full support with weights negative-exponentially proportional to number of misclassifications. Squared distance and Pinsker{\textquoteright}s approximation bounds are possibly quasi-convex and are observed to have single local minimum. We derive fixed point equations (FPEs) using partial KKT system with strict positivity constraints. This obviates the combinatorial search for subset support of the optimal posterior. For uniform prior, exponential search on a full-dimensional simplex can be limited to an ordered subset of classifiers with increasing empirical risk values. These FPEs converge rapidly to a stationary point, even for a large classifier set when a solver fails. We apply these approaches to SVMs generated using a finite set of SVM regularization parameter values on 9 UCI datasets. The resulting optimal posteriors (on the set of regularization parameters) yield stochastic SVM classifiers with tight bounds. KL-divergence based bound is the tightest, but is computationally expensive due to its non-convex nature and multiple calls to a root finding algorithm. Optimal posteriors for all 5 distance functions have lowest 10\% test error values on most datasets, with that of linear distance being the easiest to obtain.</p>},

	<p>Operations research supports decision-making in many complex systems\&nbsp;across domains. However, though OR is a well-established field in its\&nbsp;own right, it is quite unrecognised and under-appreciated. The problem\&nbsp;is compounded by the fact that OR professionals / researchers are\&nbsp;themselves quite unclear about ""What is OR?"", or unable to explain it\&nbsp;confidently or satisfactorily to the public at large. This vagueness\&nbsp;about OR often poses a barrier for novice learners/ students to join the\&nbsp;OR stream/ employ OR methods effectively. Further, OR community will be\&nbsp;increasingly looked upon to play a key role as an anchor to address\&nbsp;""wicked"" problems (incl. sustainable development goals), and steer the\&nbsp;realisation of solutions. This requires us to have a common\&nbsp;understanding about OR, and perhaps introspect our role as OR\&nbsp;professionals.<br />
	<br />
	In this talk I will attempt to provide a satisfactory answer to the\&nbsp;question ""What is OR?"". Drawing on my own experiences, I argue for a\&nbsp;strong empirical base for research \&amp; practice activities of OR, and the\&nbsp;challenges therein. I also discuss the skill sets required to create<br />
	complete \&amp; holistic OR professionals. This, I believe, will go a long\&nbsp;way in building a strong community of complete OR professionals to\&nbsp;work\&nbsp;on problems that matter .</p>},
